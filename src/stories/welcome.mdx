## Understanding RRule

`rrule` is a library that helps with recurring date calculations in JavaScript. It implements the iCalendar (RFC 5545) specification in a straightforward API to repeat occurrences of events. `rrule` can be used for generating dates for all recurring events like meetings, reminders, and daily/weekly/monthly schedules.

Here are some key features of `rrule`:
- Generate occurrence dates of an event
- Work with complex recurring event rules
- Convert between JavaScript dates and universal time

This combination of Storybook and `rrule` allows for detailed testing and visualization of components that involve date calculations and recurring event management.
