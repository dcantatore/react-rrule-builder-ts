# Welcome to Storybook

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and many other frameworks. It enables developers to create components independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment. Storybook also supports tools for accessibility testing, theming, and component interaction simulations.

## Understanding RRule

`rrule` is a library that helps with recurring date calculations in JavaScript. It implements the iCalendar (RFC 5545) specification in a straightforward API to repeat occurrences of events. `rrule` can be used for generating dates for all recurring events like meetings, reminders, and daily/weekly/monthly schedules.

Here are some key features of `rrule`:
- Generate occurrence dates of an event
- Work with complex recurring event rules
- Convert between JavaScript dates and universal time

This combination of Storybook and `rrule` allows for detailed testing and visualization of components that involve date calculations and recurring event management.

## Adding Stories

To add a new story, create a new file in the `src/stories` directory or co-located with your components. You can use the `src/stories/welcome.mdx` file to show a welcome message or to provide documentation for your Storybook.

View the example in ButtonExample story as a learning resource for creating your own stories.
